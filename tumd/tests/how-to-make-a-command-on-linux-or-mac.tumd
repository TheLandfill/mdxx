<i>Since both Linux and Mac are based off Unix, the methods in this tutorial
will work for both.
Since I'm not a Windows user anymore and I never used the terminal on Windows, I
cannot provide a good explanation of <a
href="https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Create-your-own-Commands-with-Batch/">how
to make a command on Windows</a>.</i>

Although the purpose of a computer is to automate tasks, programmers still have
to do some tasks manually.
For instance, to set up a {C}/{C++} project on my computer, I would have to
create a bunch of directories, copy a Makefile (it's a project file for
{C/C++}) into the right directory, modify the Makefile to generate the specific
program, etc.
Doing so requires me to remember both the directories I need to create and where
I stored the original Makefile.
Furthermore, since I wrote the Makefile specifically for {C++} projects, I have to
change it for {C} projects.
Lastly, if I mess up any of the steps above, I have to spend even more time to
find the error.
All in all, it's a waste of time and effort to go through this process to set up
a project, especially since I have to follow the same exact steps for every
project.

Since I was typing in the same bash commands over and over again, I decided to
write a script that would execute the bash commands for me whenever I ran it.
Since I wanted to be able to use the script from any directory, I decided to
make the script into the Linux command, which I called <a
href="https://github.com/TheLandfill/minit">minit</a>.

In this article, I'm going to discuss what a command is, the basics of how the
terminal processes commands, and how to make one yourself.
I will use {minit}, as a guide.
To run {minit}, you need to run {./install.sh} so it can figure out where the
specific files are and ensure it's not overwriting any other commands.
To make {minit} a command, we don't necessarily need it to run properly, but if
you do want it to run and use this tutorial, type {./install.sh tutorial} into
your terminal instead of {./install.sh}.
You can also remove the command by running {./uninstall.sh} and then deleting
the whole {minit} directory.
I will assume that the {minit.sh} script is in the directory {~/dev/minit} as if
you ran {git clone https://github.com/TheLandfill/minit} while in the directory
{~/dev}.

# What is a Command?

As with most topics involving computers, there is a distinction between what a
command is to the user and what a command is to the computer.

To the user, <b>commands are phrases you type into the terminal that allow you
to interact with the computer</b>.

\{{aside}}
#### Why Use a Terminal?
<hr>

Before computers were powerful enough to use Graphical User Interfaces (GUI),
which you would recognize as your desktop where you click icons to run programs
or open windows, you had to use the terminal to do anything on your computer.
While GUIs may be more intuitive for first time users, the terminal is much more
powerful than a GUI because the terminal can automate processes the GUI can't.

For example, if I were to use a GUI to do what {minit} does, I would have to
create a new directory with the project name, move to that directory, create
{bin}, {obj}, {src}, and {includes}, copy the {Makefile} (whose location I would
have to remember) into the {bin} directory and then go through the Makefile and
change what I need to change to make it actually work.

With {minit}, I type {minit project-name outfile-name} and I'm done.

As another example, I went on a trip and took a ton of photos, but since I
couldn't force everyone to wait for me to get all the settings exactly right to
take the best possible picture, I took a bunch of pictures of the same object
with different settings (stuff like exposure and white balance) in the hopes
that at least one of them would be good.
I ended up taking hundreds more pictures than I was going to use and I needed to
get rid of them.
I figured that if I could group together pictures that were taken around the
same time, I would group together pictures of the same object, which would make
it easier for me to get rid of the bad pictures.

Doing so manually would have required me to look at the file name (which is
based on the time at which the picture was taken) and sort them into folders.
Using a bash script, however, I was able to group each picture into its proper
folder, which made finding bad pictures a lot easier.

\{{\aside}}

If you have any experience with bash, you'll already know some standard
commands, such as {cd} (change current directory), {mv} (move or rename files
and directories), and {cp} (copy files).
If you're a little more experienced, you might know about some more complex
commands, such as {sudo} (gives a command temporary root/admin privileges) or
{python} (runs the python interpreter).
Because you can't do much in the terminal without these commands and they come
on most terminals, people often assume that they're built in.
While some commands are ({cd} is because it's directly related to the terminal),
most are not.

To the computer, <b>commands are executables in a specific directory, aliases,
functions, or builtins</b>.
In this article, we'll discuss how to make an executable into a command, how to
make an alias, and how to make a function into a command.
In general, you won't be able to write a builtin and functions are usually best
used for simple, frequently used commands that you couldn't use an alias for.
You'll see an example of both a builtin and a function later, and we'll go into
more detail about the specifics.

\{{aside}}
#### Quick Note on Aliases
<hr>

You can make an alias out of almost anything you could type on the command line,
but aliases have severe limits on what they can do.
They also rely on builtins and other bash commands.
We'll discuss <a href="#what-if-i-dont-need-an-entire-executable">how to create
an alias</a> later in the article.
Since {minit} is too complex to be an alias, I had to use a script.

\{{\aside}}

You can use the {which} command to see which executable the computer will run
when you type in a command.
Commands that are not executables (like {cd}) won't print out anything when you
run {which}.
Instead, you can use the {type} command to determine what a command is in the
general case.
Using {type -a NAME} will display all locations containing an executable named
NAME including aliases, builtins, and functions.
For example:

\{{terminal}}
{{prompt}} which cd
{{prompt}} type -a cd
cd is a function
cd ()
{
    builtin cd "$@" && chpwd
}
cd is a shell builtin
{{prompt}} which mv
/bin/mv
{{prompt}} which cp
/bin/cp
{{prompt}} which sudo
/usr/bin/sudo
{{prompt}} which python
/usr/bin/python

\{{\terminal}}

\{{aside}}
#### Why is {cd} a Function?
<hr>

I had to write a function that modified the behavior of {cd} slightly so that my
prompt <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/217097">displays the current
and parent directories</a>, but it doesn't matter for the tutorial.
On most computers, {cd} will be a shell builtin.
Since the only way to write a shell builtin is to write or modify a shell, we
aren't going to deal with that here.
Since I use cd frequently, the actual function is simple (it calls the builtin
{cd} and then runs another function if the builtin {cd} ran properly), and I
need to call it instead of the builtin {cd} (see the <a
href="#more-directories-means-more-to-search">command hierarchy</a> I describe
later in the article for more info), I had to make it a function.
If you want more information on when to use a function, alias, or script to make
a command, see <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/30964">this answer</a>
on StackOverflow.
<a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/30964">This answer on
StackOverflow</a> gives some reasons for why you would choose to use a function,
alias, or script.

Also, notice that it prints out both that {cd is a function} and {cd is a shell
builtin}.
In other words, multiple commands are named {cd}, but the computer will run just
the first one when you type {cd} into the console.

\{{\aside}}

Most of the other commands are actually executables in either {/bin} or
{/usr/bin/}.
You can run any executable in either of these directories from anywhere like a
bash command.
Other directories can also have commands, and these directories are listed in
the {PATH} environment variable.
To see the full list, type {echo $PATH} into your terminal.

\{{terminal}}
{{prompt}} echo $PATH
/home/joseph/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games
\{{\terminal}}

You should see a list of directories separated by colons, as shown above.
{PATH} contains plain text, which means altering it will require us to replace
the old text with the new text.

## Making an Executable

Before you can run an executable, you have to tell the system which users can
run it by using the {chmod} command.
The {chmod} command allows you to set who can read, write, and execute a file.
In most cases, you can use {chmod 755 exe}, which will allow anyone to execute
{exe} and allow the user to modify it.
This <a
href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/932713/what-is-the-difference-between-chmod-x-and-chmod-755">
article on chmod</a> and the man page for chmod (which you can see by typing
{man chmod} in the terminal) contain more information about the {chmod} command.

## Absolute vs. Relative Paths

An absolute filepath starts from either your root directory, {/}, or your home
directory, {~/}.
The {~/} is shorthand for {/home/[username]}, where {[username]} is the username
of the person currently logged in.
A relative filepath starts from your current directory in the terminal and moves
around to different directories.
When making commands, they have to properly run in any directory, meaning your
current directory is going to change, meaning any relative filepaths you use
will be wrong.
<b>If you want to make use of a specific file or directory, then you must use an
absolute path.</b>
For example, {minit} copies the Makefile in {~/dev/minit/} (or wherever you
clone the project) into a different directory, so it needs an absolute path.
{minit} needs to create new directories from your current location, so it uses
relative paths.

# Making a Command

Since any executable must be in one of the directories specified in {PATH}, we
now have two ways to turn an executable into a command.

\{{ul}}

Add the directory containing your executable to the {PATH} variable.

Move the executable into one of the directories in {PATH}.

\{{\ul}}

While both of these methods will work, we want to set up some criteria for
determining the best method.
As with most programming projects, we have to focus on user experience and ease
of development.
We'll use the standard bash commands as a guide for user experience and general
development knowledge for development ease.
The method we use to create a command should

\{{ul}}

look like a standard bash command, since <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">that's what
people expect</a>.

not create extraneous commands.

work with the organization of a project or, at least, not complicate the project.

use the fewest resources it can.

require the user to do as little as possible to update the command.

work on most, if not all, standard Linux distros and most modern Mac computers.

\{{\ul}}

## Adding a Directory to the {PATH} Variable

\{{aside style="border-width: 8px; border-radius: 12px;"}}
<h3 style="color: red; text-align: center">WARNING</h3><hr>

Before you interact with anything related to the operating system or anything
related to configurations, always make sure to back your data up.
Modifying {PATH} doesn't severely modify your configuration, but you should
still back your {PATH} variable up.
In this case, make sure to record the value of {PATH} somewhere so you can
revert it back to normal.
You can use {echo $PATH} to print out {PATH} to the terminal.
If you mess up and don't record the value of {PATH}, record its current value
using {echo $PATH}, then run the command:

\{{terminal}}
{{prompt}} export PATH="$(echo $PATH | sed "s/:[^:]*\/dev\/minit//g")"
\{{\terminal}}

This command will search your {PATH} variable for any string starting with a
colon and ending with {/dev/minit} and remove it from {PATH}.
If your command is in a different directory, replace {\/dev\/minit} with your
path to the directory, making sure that you add a backslash before every slash.

\{{\aside}}

Add the directory to your PATH variable using the syntax:

\{{terminal}}
{{prompt}} export PATH=$PATH:~/dev/minit
\{{\terminal}}

It's that simple.

The {export} will mean that all that the current and all future terminal
windows/bash sessions you create will also have {PATH} set, {PATH=} will set the
{PATH} environment variable to everything that's after it, {$PATH} will expand
out the contents of {PATH} (which include all the directories in {PATH}), and
{:~/dev/minit} will be expanded to {:/home/[username]/dev/minit} (where
{[username]} is the username of the current user) and then appended to the
contents of {PATH}.
Now, you can call every executable in the directory from anywhere.
You will have to type the command every time you log into your computer unless
you have some script that automatically runs when you login.
Instead of making your own, though, add the command to the end of your
{~/.bash_profile} or {~/.profile} file.
It's one of the <a href="https://superuser.com/a/183980">main scripts that runs
when you login</a>.
Once again, <b style="color: #FF0000">DO NOT MODIFY IMPORTANT SYSTEM FILES OR
VARIABLES WITHOUT MAKING SOME SORT OF A BACKUP</b>.

### Multiple Executables in a Directory

We wanted to create the {minit} command, but now every executable is a command.
Some of these commands will not work, but could still lead to some unwanted
behavior.
Worse, if a file in the directory was executable even though it shouldn't be
executable (such as a text file or a Makefile), you could end up running
dangerous code.

\{{aside}}
#### Almost a Tragedy
<hr>

I ran {Makefile} to see what would happen, and it interpreted as a bash script.
Unfortunately for me, it had one interpretable bash command in it: {rm -rf
$(OBJDIR)/* $(PRODUCT) $(DEBUG_PRODUCT)}, which will remove all the intermediate
files and all the executables the Makefile generates.
When using {make} to interpret the {Makefile}, that command does what it's
supposed to do.
If you don't set any of the variables ({$(OBJDIR)}, {$(PRODUCT)}, and
{$(DEBUG_PRODUCT)}) because you didn't use {make}, they will be empty, meaning
I ran {<a
href="https://www.tecmint.com/10-most-dangerous-commands-you-should-never-execute-on-linux/">rm
-rf &#8203; /*</a>}, which is almost the most dangerous command you can run on
a Linux system.
It's actually worse than deleting {system32} on a Windows computer, because at
least you still have your personal files.
{rm -rf /*} will actually try to delete everything on your computer.
Fortunately, it can't delete any files you would need root privileges to modify.
Unfortunately, it can delete any files you can modify without root privileges,
which mainly includes your personal files.
I didn't lose anything because it didn't have any root privileges and it hadn't
reached anything important before I killed it using {Ctrl-c}.
You won't be able to execute the Makefile for this reason.

\{{\aside}}

Now, you could move the script into a different directory, and add that
directory to the {PATH}, and you would have one executable.
In practice, having your executable in a different directory could lead to some
problems or at least annoyances, as it might disrupt the organization of your
project.
In a {C}/{C++} project, I would have to change directories every time I wanted
to rebuild the project and execute the command, which doesn't sound like a lot
until you have to find an error by hand because your debugger isn't working
properly or you want to make some slight changes to make sure everything is
working properly.
Furthermore, I generally have a release and a debug version of a {C}/{C++}
program, which means the debug command will also be a command unless I
rearrange the build system around it.

### More Directories Means More to Search

This issue isn't as big a deal as having more executables than you wanted, but
it's still a potential issue.
When you type in a command to the terminal, the computer will look through all
the commands in a specified order.
On my terminal ({Linux Mint 19.1 Tessa} with {bash 4.4.19}), the order seems to
be

\{{ol}}

user-defined functions

builtin functions

executables in the first directory in {PATH}

executables in the second directory in {PATH}

...

executables in the last directory in {PATH}

\{{\ol}}

Adding a directory or two won't hurt, but adding a lot of them could mean it
takes a little bit longer for your commands to execute.
A computer will still be quick enough that you wouldn't notice a difference
except in some extreme circumstances.
You will need to edit the {PATH} variable whenever you want to remove a command,
which means going into your {~/.bash_profile} or {~/.profile} and finding the
specific directory you added and removing it, then using the method above in the
WARNING aside to remove it from the current {PATH} variable.

### Name Clash

You saw earlier that {type -a} listed the function I wrote for {cd} before the
builtin {cd}, but let's do a little experiment.
We're going to create two empty executables in two different directories
specified in {PATH}, and we'll see which one the computer will run.
To prevent anything bad from happening, we're going to come up with an unused
command name.
I'm going to use {hello-world}, since it's not a command on my system.
To test if the command isn't on your system, use {type hello-world}, which
should say something like "not found" or "does not exist".
I'm going to pick {/usr/games} and {/usr/local/games} since they don't contain
anything important (one is empty and the other one contains <a
href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/espdiff">espdiff</a>, which I'll let you
figure out).
We're going to use the {touch} command, which creates an empty file if the file
doesn't exist and does nothing if the file already exists.

\{{terminal}}
{{prompt}} type hello-world
bash: type: hello-world: not found
{{prompt}} sudo touch /usr/games/hello-world
{{prompt}} sudo chmod 755 /usr/games/hello-world
{{prompt}} sudo touch /usr/local/games/hello-world
{{prompt}} sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/games/hello-world
{{prompt}} type -a hello-world
hello-world is /usr/games/hello-world
hello-world is /usr/local/games/hello-world
{{prompt}} which hello-world
/usr/games/hello-world
{{prompt}} sudo rm /usr/games/hello-world
{{prompt}} sudo rm /usr/local/games/hello-world
\{{\terminal}}

Notice that {/usr/games/hello-world} shows up before
{/usr/local/games/hello-world} and that {which} returns
{/usr/games/hello-world}.
This experiment shows several things:

\{{ul}}

There can be multiple executables with the same name as another script.

Bash will go through all the directories in {PATH} and choose the first
executable with the name you provided.

Therefore, <b>the computer will only run the first executable</b>.

Furthermore, <b>you could end up running the wrong executable</b>.

\{{\ul}}

I don't think this issue will come up too often, but I can think of a much more
common name clash.
You'll notice that I called one of the executables in {minit} called
{install.sh}.
In the context of the {minit} directory, {install.sh} makes perfect sense.
In the general context of the entire file system, it doesn't.
If you have another code base with its own {install.sh} executable, you could
end up running a different {install.sh}, which, like the {Makefile} command
earlier, could harm your computer.

### Extensions on Names

Commands with extensions ({.sh}, {.py}, etc.) will keep their extensions if you
make them commands using this method.
While you could remove the extension, you shouldn't.
You can no longer search for the script based on its extension and you would
have to open the file to determine the language of script.

## Moving or Copying the Executable into One of the Directories in {PATH}

Either {cp} or {mv} will work.
Since they have the same exact syntax, I'll use {cp}.
If you've run {./install.sh tutorial}, then the script should still work.

\{{terminal}}
{{prompt}} sudo cp minit/minit.sh /usr/local/bin/
\{{\terminal}}

This solution is much better than adding your whole directory to {PATH}, as you
don't get unwanted executables, there are fewer directories to search, and you
don't have to worry about name clashes.
In fact, <b>if you're just distributing the executable to users who don't care
about the source code, you can just give them the executable and move it into a
directory in {PATH}</b>.
Since the user no longer cares about the details of the executable, the
extenstion doesn't matter nearly as much.

If you do care about the source code and your executable is part of the source
code, this solution introduces some new problems.

\{{ul}}

Scattered Build System

Manual Updates

Duplicate Files

Accidental Overwrite

\{{\ul}}

### Scattered Build System

You could restructure your build system to have the executable in one of the
{PATH} directories, but then you have a major organizational problem.
Your code is now spread into multiple directories.
How would you share the code with someone else?
You would have to log all the files manually, assemble them, and send them over
with instructions on where to put the executables.
You also couldn't use git or most other version control systems, as most VCSs
require the project to be inside the same directory.
In general, poor organization at any level of a software project could lead to
<a
href="https://medium.com/existek/what-is-technical-debt-and-how-to-calculate-it-80193e4e746d">technical
debt</a>, which can kill your project if you don't pay it off.

### Manual Updates

If you decide to keep the executable as part of a separate project, then you
will have to recopy or replace the executable whenever or someone else updates
the code.
You might also need to use {sudo} if you're using an important directory, like
{/usr/local/bin}.

Other than manual updates, this solution is almost optimal.
It keeps everything organized, the executables you want to be commands will be
commands, the executables you don't want to be commands won't be commands, no
name clashes, and {PATH} doesn't fill up with a bunch of minor directories.
You still have to manually update the executable in {PATH}.

### Duplicate Files

If you decide to copy the file into {PATH}, you'll end up wasting memory, but
you will be able to rename your command to whatever you want.

### Accidental Overwrite

If you're not careful, you could end up overwriting a file that already exists.
Before making a command, running {type} on the command will make sure it doesn't
exist.

# A Better Way?

As you can see, none of the methods above will satisfy all the criteria I
suggested.
Unfortunately, there is no way to make an executable a command unless the
executable is in one of the directories in {PATH}.
Reviewing the problems with the proposed solutions and the criteria, we can come
up with our ideal solution:

\{{ul}}
There must be a file named {minit} in one of the directories in {PATH} or we
will not have a command.

{minit} must be an executable.

{minit} must update when {minit.sh} updates.

Nothing in the code base must depend on {minit}.

{minit} shouldn't waste space.

Making {minit} shouldn't rely on anything unique to a specific Linux distro or Mac version.

\{{\ul}}

## Symlinks

Most operating systems (including Linux, Mac, and Windows) have a built in
filetype that will allow us to satisfy all the criteria for a command, which is
known as a <a href="https://kb.iu.edu/d/abbe">symbolic link</a> or "symlink" for
short.
Symlinks consist of a file or directory name, some metadata (e.g. the time the
link was last modified), and that's it.
Most symlinks take up less than one hundred bytes, while executables can often
take up orders of magnitude more space.
Since symlinks are separate files, they don't have to share the same name,
meaning the symlink can leave the extension off while the executable can keep it
on.
Symlinks also won't affect anything in the code base since they're not part of
it.
And since symlinks contain just a filepath and metadata, you only need to update
a symlink if you move the linked executable.
To create our symlink for this command, use

\{{terminal}}
{{prompt}} sudo ln -s ~/dev/minit/minit.sh /usr/local/bin/minit
\{{\terminal}}

Note that we used an absolute path and not a relative path since we want to run
the command from everywhere.
You can also have a symlink with a relative path as long as the relative link
always points to the same file or directory.

Now, you can still add directories to your {PATH}, like if you wanted to have a
directory filled with your commands so you didn't mix them in with any other
commands.
For example, I made {/usr/nonlocal/physics/} for my physics programs on an older
computer.
If you did, you would treat it like I have treated {/usr/local/bin/}, where you
store the symlinks in your personal command directory.

# What if I Don't Need an Entire Executable?

Often, you won't need an entire executable for a simple command.
I generally use the command line text editor {vim}, and, while I do like it, it
has some weird quirks compared to modern text editors.
When you open multiple files at once with {vim}, it will open them like an old
Unix terminal: you have to cycle through them and there's one open at a time.
{vim} can open them in tabs (like a modern text editor) if you use {vim -p} on
the command line.
Since I strongly prefer using tabs as opposed to the old Unix style, I wanted
to make a command that would work as if I had typed {vim -p}.
If I were to write a bash script, it would have one line of code.
In this case, I would use an <b>alias</b>.

Aliases have an easy syntax.

\{{code-block bash no-line-numbers}}
alias vip="vim -p"
\{{\code-block}}

This line will create a command called {vip} that will run {vim -p} whenever
you call it.
Since I want it to stay across login sessions, I needed to put it in one of
those scripts that run when you login or create a new terminal.
On my computer, my {~/.bashrc} would run all the commands in the file
{~/.bash_aliases} if it existed, so I created the {~/.bash_aliases} and put the
alias in there and it worked as expected.

You can also use a function by writing a function in bash and putting it in one
of the scripts that run when you login or create a new terminal.

# What About Package Managers Like {apt} for Ubuntu and {brew} for Mac?

In this tutorial, I haven't actually told you how to distribute executables.
For {minit}, I just used a github repository from which you could download the
necessary executables and files because it's just a few short scripts.
To install most programs in something like Ubuntu (which I'm focusing on since
it's one of the largest Linux distros), however, you would go through the
package manager, {apt}, like so:

\{{terminal}}

{{prompt}} sudo apt install [executable]

\{{\terminal}}

If you aren't using Ubuntu, search for {[distro] package manager} online (where
{[distro]} is your Linux distro) and replace {apt} in the command above with
your package manager.

On a Mac, you would use {brew} (if you don't have brew set up, follow the <a
href="https://www.howtogeek.com/211541/homebrew-for-os-x-easily-installs-desktop-apps-and-terminal-utilities/">instructions
on setting up brew for Mac</a>) like so:

\{{terminal}}

{{prompt}} brew install [executable]

\{{\terminal}}

Furthermore, there are sometimes package managers specific to languages, such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(package_manager)">{pip}</a> for
{python} and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">{npm}</a> for {javascript}.

Package managers are out of the scope of this article, but the general process
for having your package manager recognize and install your software is to either
send the source code for the software to the people in charge of the package
manager with a request for them to include it in one of their repositories or to
tell people who want to install your software to add your specific repository to
their lists of repositories for the password manager to check.

To be clear, the people in charge of the package manager differ in how they want
you to send them your software, which is why I can't explain more in this long
article.
To start you off, though, someone already asked <a
href="https://askubuntu.com/q/16446">how to get software into Ubuntu</a> on
StackExchange, the people behind {brew} wrote their own documentation on <a
href="https://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook">how to add a package to
{brew}</a>, someone already wrote a guide on <a

# Summary

\{{ul}}

Linux and Mac commands are generally executables in one of the directories
defined in {PATH}, aliases, or shell builtins.

Creating your own command generally means adding an alias or putting an
executable in {PATH}.

We can add or remove directories to {PATH}.

Some scripts run when you login and you can customize them to alter the behavior
of your computer or terminal.

We can also move or copy the executable to any directory already in {PATH}.

Symlinks are files that point to other files.

Symlinks will allow us to achieve all the criteria we made for commands.

Use aliases when your command is simple.

Use functions when you don't need to write an entire executable and you need
functionality that an alias can't provide.
