	<div class="main">
		<h2>Intro</h2>
		<p>I'm going to go through a step by step example of how I would generally make a Linux command.
			For this example, I will use an actual command I made to help me set up a build system for c++ projects, which I called <a href="https://github.com/TheLandfill/minit">minit</a>.
			This command automates several things I had to do manually whenever I wanted to create a c/c++ project, including creating the relevant directories, copying a generic Makefile from a specific location (it's a c/c++ thing) into the project, etc.
			To sucessfully run the command, you need to run <code>install.sh</code> because it needs to figure out where to create the symbolic links and it needs to make sure it's not overwriting any other commands.
			To make it a command, however, we don't necessarily need it to run correctly.
			If you do want it to run correctly and use this tutorial, just type <code>./install.sh tutorial</code> into your terminal instead of just <code>./install.sh</code>.
			You can also uninstall the program completely by running <code>uninstall.sh</code> and then deleting the whole <code>minit</code> directory.
			I will assume that the <code>minit.sh</code> script is in the directory <code>~/dev/minit</code> as if you ran <code>git clone https://github.com/TheLandfill/minit</code> while in the directory <code>~/dev</code>.
		<h2>What Exactly is a Linux Command?</h2>
		<p> If you have any experience with Linux or bash, you'll already know a few standard Linux commands, such as <code>cd</code> (change current directory), <code>mv</code> (move or rename files and folders), and <code>cp</code> (copy files).
			If you're a little more experienced, you might know about some more complex commands, such as <code>sudo</code> (gives a command temporary root/admin privileges) or <code>python</code> (runs the python interpretor).
			Because you can't do much in the terminal without these commands and they come on most terminals, people often assume that they're built in.
			While a few of them are (<code>cd</code> usually is because it's directly related to the terminal), most are not.
			</p>
			<p><b>Linux commands are usually either executables in a specific folder or "aliases".</b></p>
			<div class="aside">
			<h4>Quick Note on Aliases</h4><hr>
			<p>You can make an alias out of most things you could type on the command line, but aliases have severe limits on what they can do.
			They also rely on builtins and other Linux commands.
			We'll discuss how to create an alias later in the article.
			Since <code>minit</code> is too complex to be an alias, I had to use a script.
			</div>
			You can use the <code>which</code> command to see exactly which executable will be run when you type in a command.
			Commands that are not executable scripts (like <code>cd</code>) won't print out anything when you run <code>which</code>.
			Instead, you can use the <code>type</code> command to determine what a command is in the general case.
			For example:
		</p>
		<div class="terminal"><pre><span style="color:#E23434"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#DC1F63"><b>~/dev</b></span>$ which cd
<span style="color:#E23434"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#DC1F63"><b>~/dev</b></span>$ type cd
cd is a function
cd ()
{
	builtin cd "$@" && chpwd
}
cd is a shell builtin
<span style="color:#E23434"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#DC1F63"><b>~/dev</b></span><span style="color:#DC1111">$ which mv
/bin/mv</span>
<span style="color:#E23434"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#DC1F63"><b>~/dev</b></span><span style="color:#DC1111">$ which cp
/bin/cp</span>
<span style="color:#E23434"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#DC1F63"><b>~/dev</b></span><span style="color:#DC1111">$ which sudo
/usr/bin/sudo</span>
<span style="color:#E23434"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#DC1F63"><b>~/dev</b></span><span style="color:#DC1111">$ which python
/usr/bin/python</span></pre>
	</div>
		<div class="aside"><p>On my computer, I had to write a function that modified the behavior of <code>cd</code> slightly so that my prompt only displays the current and parent directory, but it doesn't matter for the tutorial.
		On most of your computers, <code>cd</code> will just be a shell builtin.
		Since the only way to write a shell builtin is to write or modify a shell, we aren't going to deal with that here.
		</p>
		<p>I also want you to notice that, in my case, it prints out both that <code>cd is a function</code> and <code>cd is a shell builtin</code>.
		In other words, there are multiple commands named <code>cd</code>, but only the first one will be run when you type <code>cd</code> into the console.
		</p>
		</div>
		<p>Most of the other commands are actually just executables in either <code>/bin</code> or <code>/usr/bin/</code>.
		Any executable in either of these folders can be run from anywhere just like a Linux command.
		There are several other directories that can also have commands, which are contained in the PATH environment variable.
		To see the full list, type <code>echo $PATH</code> into your terminal.
		</p>
		<div class="terminal"><pre><span style="color:#E23434"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#DC1F63"><b>~/dev</b></span>$ echo $PATH
/home/joseph/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games</pre></div>
		<p>You should see a list of directories separated by colons, as shown above.
		<code>PATH</code> is just text, which will determine how we alter it later.
		</p>
		<h2>Making an Executable</h2>
		<p>Before you can run an executable, you have to tell the system which users can run it by using the <code>chmod</code> command.
		The <code>chmod</code> command allows you to set who can read, write, and exexecute a file.
		In most cases, you can use <code>chmod 755 exe</code>, which will allow anyone to execute <code>exe</code>, but only the user can modify it.
		For more information about the intricacies of the <code>chmod</code> command, see <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/932713/what-is-the-difference-between-chmod-x-and-chmod-755">here</a>, <a href="https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/06/chmod-command-examples/">here</a>, or read the man page by typing <code>man chmod</code> in the terminal.
		</p>
		<h1>Making a Linux Command</h1>
		<p>Since any executable must be in one of the directories specified in <code>PATH</code>, we now have a few ways to turn an executable into a Linux command.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Add the directory containing your executable to the <code>PATH</code> variable.</li>
			<li>Move the executable into one of the directories currently in PATH.</li>
			<li>Create a symbolic link to your executable in one of the directories in <code>PATH</code>.
		</ul>
		<h2>Adding a Directory to the <code>PATH</code> Variable</h2>
		<div class="aside" style="border-width: 8px;">
		<h3 style="color: red; text-align: center;">WARNING</h3><hr>
		<p>Before you modify anything system related, always make sure to back your data up.
		Modifying <code>PATH</code> isn't too severe, but it could still be annoying. Just make sure to record the value of <code>PATH</code> somewhere so you can revert it back to normal.
		You can use <code>echo $PATH</code> to print out <code>PATH</code> to the terminal.
		If you mess up and don't record the value of <code>PATH</code>, record it as it currently is using <code>echo $PATH</code>, then run the command:</p>
		<div class="terminal"><pre><span style="color:#E23434"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#DC1F63"><b>~/dev</b></span>$ export PATH="$(echo $PATH | sed "s/:[^:]*\/dev\/minit//g")"</pre>
		</div>
		<p>This command will search your <code>PATH</code> variable for any string starting with a colon and ending with <code>/dev/minit</code> and remove it from <code>PATH</code>.
		If your command is in a different directory, replace <code>\/dev\/minit</code> with your path to the directory, making sure that you add a backslash before every slash.
		</p>
		</div>
		<p>Just add the directory to your PATH variable, using the syntax:</p>
		<div class="terminal"><pre style="white-space: nowrap;"><span style="color:#E23434"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#DC1F63"><b>~/dev</b></span>$ export PATH=$PATH:~/dev/minit</pre></div>
		<p>It's that simple.</p>
		The <code>export</code> will mean that all that the current and all future terminal windows/bash sessions you create will also have <code>PATH</code> set, <code>PATH=</code> will set the <code>PATH</code> environment variable to everything that's after it, <code>$PATH</code> will expand out the contents of <code>PATH</code> (which include all the directories currently in <code>PATH</code>), and <code>:~/dev/minit</code> will be expanded and then appended to the expanded contents of <code>PATH</code>.
		Now, every executable in the directory can be called from everywhere.
		You will have to type the command every time you log into your computer, unless you have some script that automatically runs when you login.
		Instead of making your own, though, just add the command to the end of your <code>~/.bash_profile</code> or <code>~/.profile</code> file.
		It's one of <a href="https://superuser.com/a/183980">several main scripts</a> that runs when you login.
		I decided to wait to tell you just in case you accidently did something wrong and so you wouldn't touch important system files until you realized what could go wrong.
		Once again, <b style="color: #FF0000">Do not modify important system files or variables without making some sort of a backup</b>.
		</p>
		<h3>Multiple Executables in a Directory</h3>
		We only wanted to create the <code>minit</code> command, but now you have several commands.
		Some of these commands will not work, but could still lead to some unwanted behavior.
		Worse, if a file in the directory was executable even though it really shouldn't be executable (such as a text file or a Makefile), you could end up running dangerous code that could modify things you don't want to modify.
		</p>
		<div class="aside">
		<h4>Almost a Tragedy</h4><hr>
		<p>I ran <code>Makefile</code> just to see what would happen (which is often a terrible reason to do things in computer science, at least on your computer), and it interpreted as a bash script, and it only had one bash command in it: <code>rm -rf $(OBJDIR)/* $(PRODUCT) $(DEBUG_PRODUCT)</code>, which will remove all the intermediate files and all the executables the Makefile generates.
		Normally, that command does exactly what it's supposed to do.
		If you don't set any of the variables (<code>$(OBJDIR)</code>, <code>$(PRODUCT)</code>, and <code>$(DEBUG_PRODUCT)</code>) because you didn't use <code>make</code>, however, they are blank, meaning I ran <code><a href="https://www.tecmint.com/10-most-dangerous-commands-you-should-never-execute-on-linux/">rm -rf  /*</a></code>, which is almost the most dangerous command you can run on a Linux system.
		It's actually worse than deleting system32 on a Windows computer, because at least you still have your personal files.
		<code>rm -rf /*</code> will actually try to delete everything on your computer.
		Fortunately, it can't delete any files you would need root privileges to modify.
		Unfortanately, it can delete any files you can modify without root privileges, which mainly includes your personal files.
		I didn't lose anything because it didn't have any root privileges and it hadn't reached anything important before I killed it using Ctrl-c.
		You won't be able to execute the Makefile for this reason.
		</p></div>
		<p>Now, you could move the script into a different folder, and add just that folder to the <code>PATH</code>, and you would only have one executable.
		In practice, having your executable in a different folder could lead to some problems or at least annoyances, as it might disrupt the organization of your project.
		In a c/c++ project, I would have to change directories every time I wanted to rebuild the project and execute the command, which doesn't sound like a lot until you have to find an error by hand because your debugger isn't working properly or you want to make some slight changes to make sure everything is working properly.
		Furthermore, I generally have a release and a debug version of a c/c++ program, which means the debug command will also be a command unless I rearrange the build system around it.
		</p>
		<h3>More Directories Means More to Search</h3>
		<p>This issue isn't as big a deal as having more executables than you wanted, but it's still a potential issue.
		When you type in a command to the terminal, the computer will look through all the commands in a specified order.
		On my terminal (<code>Linux Mint 19.1 Tessa</code> with <code>bash 4.4.19</code>), the order seems to be
		</p>
		<p style="text-align: center">user-defined functions<font size="+2">&#x2192;</font>builtin functions<font size="+2">&#x2192;</font>executables in the first directory in <code>PATH</code><font size="+2">&#x2192;</font>executables in the second directory in <code>PATH</code><font size="+2">&#x2192;</font>...<font size="+2">&#x2192;</font>executables in the last directory in <code>PATH</code>
		</p>
		<p>Adding a directory or two won't hurt, but adding a lot of them could mean it takes a little bit longer for your commands to execute.
		A computer will still be quick enough that you wouldn't notice a difference except in some extreme circumstances.
		You however, will need to edit the <code>PATH</code> variable whenever you want to remove a command, which means going into your <code>~/.bashrc</code> and finding the specific directory you added and removing it, then using the method above in the WARNING aside to remove it from the current <code>PATH</code> variable.
		</p>
		<h3>Name Clash</h3>
		<p>You saw earlier that the function I wrote for <code>cd</code> was mentioned before the builtin <code>cd</code>, but let's do a little experiment.
			We're going to create two empty executables in two different directories specified in <code>PATH</code>, and we'll see which one would be run.
			To prevent anything bad from happening, we're going to come up with an unused command name.
			I'm going to use <code>hello-world</code>, since it's not a command on my system.
			To test if the command isn't on your system, use <code>type -a hello-world</code>, which should say something like "not found" or "does not exist".
			I'm going to pick <code>/usr/games</code> and <code>/usr/local/games</code> since they don't contain anything important (one is empty and the other one contains <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/espdiff">espdiff</a>, which I'll let you figure out).
			We're going to use the <code>touch</code> command, which creates an empty file if the file doesn't exist and does nothing if the file already exists.
		</p>
		<div class="terminal"><pre><span style="color:#E23434"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#DC1F63"><b>~/dev</b></span>$ sudo touch /usr/games/hello-world
<span style="color:#E23434"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#DC1F63"><b>~/dev</b></span>$ sudo chmod 755 /usr/games/hello-world
<span style="color:#E23434"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#DC1F63"><b>~/dev</b></span>$ sudo touch /usr/local/games/hello-world
<span style="color:#E23434"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#DC1F63"><b>~/dev</b></span>$ sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/games/hello-world
<span style="color:#E23434"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#DC1F63"><b>~/dev</b></span>$ type -a hello-world
hello-world is /usr/games/hello-world
hello-world is /usr/local/games/hello-world
<span style="color:#E23434"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#DC1F63"><b>~/dev</b></span>$ which hello-world
/usr/games/hello-world
<span style="color:#E23434"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#DC1F63"><b>~/dev</b></span>$ sudo rm /usr/games/hello-world
<span style="color:#E23434"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#DC1F63"><b>~/dev</b></span>$ sudo rm /usr/local/games/hello-world</pre></div>
	<p>Notice that <code>/usr/games/hello-world</code> shows up before <code>/usr/local/games/hello-world</code> and that <code>which</code> returns <code>/usr/games/hello-world</code>.
		This experiment shows several things:
			<ul>
				<li>There can be multiple executables with the same name as another script.</li>
				<li>Bash will go through all the directories in <code>PATH</code> and choose the first executable with the name you provided.</li>
				<li>Therefore, <b>only the first executable will be run</b>.</li>
				<li>Furthermore, <b>you could end up running the wrong executable</b>.</li>
			</ul>
	</p>
	<p>I don't think this issue will come up too often, but I can think a much more common name clash.
		You'll notice that one of the executables in <code>minit</code> was called <code>install.sh</code>.
		In the context of the <code>minit</code> directory, <code>install.sh</code> makes perfect sense.
		In the general context of the entire file system, it doesn't.
		If you have another code base with its own <code>install.sh</code> executable, you could end up accidently running a different <code>install.sh</code>, which, just like the <code>Makefile</code> command earlier, could harm your computer.
	</p>
	<h3>Extensions on Names</h3>
	<p>Commands with extensions (<code>.sh</code>, <code>.py</code>, etc.) will keep their extensions if you make them commands using this method.
		While you could probably remove the extension in some instances, it really isn't worth it.
		You can no longer search for the script based on its extension and you would have to open the file to determine what kind of script it is.
	</p>
	<h2>Moving or Copying the Executable into One of the Directories in <code>PATH</code></h2>
	<p>Either <code>cp</code> or <code>mv</code> will work.
		Since they have the same exact syntax, I'll just use <code>cp</code>.
		If you've run <code>./install.sh tutorial</code>, then the script should still work.
	</p>
	<div class="terminal"><pre><span style="color:#E23434"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#DC1F63"><b>~/dev</b></span>$ sudo cp minit/minit.sh /usr/local/bin/</pre>
	</div>
	<p>This solution is much better than just adding your whole directory to <code>PATH</code>, as you don't get unwanted executables, there are fewer directories to search, and there is a lower chance of a name clash going unnoticed.
		You still have to deal with the extension issue, but that's mostly an aesthetic thing.
		This solution introduces two mutually exclusize problems, however:
		<ul>
			<li>Manual Updates</li>
			<li>Scattered Build System</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h3>Manual Updates</h3>
	<p>If you decide to keep the executable as part of a separate project, then you will have to recopy or replace the executable whenever you update the code.
