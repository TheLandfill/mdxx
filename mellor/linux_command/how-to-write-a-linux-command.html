		<h2>Intro</h2>
		<p>I'm going to go through a step by step example of how I would generally make a Linux command.
			For this example, I will use an actual command I made to help me set up a build system for c++ projects, which I called <a href="https://github.com/TheLandfill/minit">minit</a>.
			This command automates several things I had to do manually whenever I wanted to create a c/c++ project, including creating the relevant directories, copying a generic Makefile from a specific location (c/c++ thing) into the project, etc.
		<h2>What Exactly is a Linux Command?</h2>
		<p> If you have any experience with Linux or bash, you'll already know a few standard Linux commands, such as <code>cd</code> (change current directory), <code>mv</code> (move or rename files and folders), and <code>cp</code> (copy files).
			If you're a little more experienced, you might know about some more complex commands, such as <code>sudo</code> (gives a command temporary admin privileges) or <code>python</code> (runs the python interpretor).
			Because you can't do much in the terminal without these commands and they come on most terminals, people often assume that they're built in.
			While a few of them are (<code>cd</code> usually is because it's directly related to the terminal), most are not.
			</p>
			<p><b>Linux commands are usually either executables in a specific folder or "aliases".</b></p>
			<div class="aside">
			<h4>Quick Note on Aliases</h4><hr>
			<p>You can make an alias out of most things you could type on the command line, but aliases have severe limits on what they can do.
			They also rely on builtins and other Linux commands.
			We'll discuss how to create an alias later in the article.
			Since <code>minit</code> is too complex to be an alias, I had to use a script.
			</div>
			Anyway, you can use the <code>which</code> command to see exactly which executable will be run when you type in a command.
			Commands that are not executable scripts (like <code>cd</code>) won't print out anything when you run <code>which</code>.
			Instead, you can use the <code>type</code> command to determine what a command is in the general case.
			For example:
		</p>
		<div class="terminal"><pre><span style="color:#E23434"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#DC1F63"><b>~/dev</b></span>$ which cd
<span style="color:#E23434"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#DC1F63"><b>~/dev</b></span>$ type -a cd
cd is a function
cd ()
{
	builtin cd "$@" && chpwd
}
<span style="color:#E23434"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#DC1F63"><b>~/dev</b></span><span style="color:#DC1111">$ which mv
/bin/mv</span>
<span style="color:#E23434"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#DC1F63"><b>~/dev</b></span><span style="color:#DC1111">$ which cp
/bin/cp</span>
<span style="color:#E23434"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#DC1F63"><b>~/dev</b></span><span style="color:#DC1111">$ which sudo
/usr/bin/sudo</span>
<span style="color:#E23434"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#DC1F63"><b>~/dev</b></span><span style="color:#DC1111">$ which python
/usr/bin/python</span></pre>
	</div>
		<p>On my computer, I had to write a function that modified the behavior of <code>cd</code> slightly so that my prompt only displays the current and parent directory, but it doesn't matter for the tutorial.
		On most of your computers, <code>cd</code> will just be a shell builtin.
		Since the only way to write a shell builtin is to write or modify a shell, we aren't going to deal with that here.
		</p>
		<p>Most of the other commands are actually just executables in either <code>/bin</code> or <code>/usr/bin/</code>.
		Any executable in either of these folders can be run from anywhere just like a Linux command.
		There are several other directories that can also have commands, which are contained in the PATH environment variable.
		To see the full list, type <code>echo $PATH</code> into your terminal.
		</p>
		<div class="terminal"><pre><span style="color:#E23434"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#DC1F63"><b>~/dev</b></span>$ echo $PATH
/home/joseph/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games</pre></div>
		<p>You should see a list of directories separated by colons, as shown above.
		</p>
		<h2>Making an Executable</h2>
		<p>Before you can run an executable, you have to tell the system which users can run it by using the <code>chmod</code> command.
		The <code>chmod</code> command allows you to set who can read, write, and exexecute a file.
		In most cases, you can use <code>chmod 755 exe</code>, which will allow anyone to execute <code>exe</code>, but only the user can modify it.
		For more information about the intricacies of the <code>chmod</code> command, see <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/932713/what-is-the-difference-between-chmod-x-and-chmod-755">here</a>, <a href="https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/06/chmod-command-examples/">here</a>, or read the man page by typing <code>man chmod</code> in the terminal.
